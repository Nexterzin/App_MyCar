A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project marks a new journey in programming with Dart/Flutter, as I explore new tools and update the application.

The app's main purpose is to keep track of vehicle maintenance with extensive details. It allows users to record car 
upgrades, such as performance and design enhancements, and store essential car information.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
